# coda std libraries
> IMPORTANT! This library has not been finished. It is still in development.

This is the repository for the coda standard libraries. Coda is a
programming language made by me and although it looks really similar to java
and has many features java has it's a complete own language. I am thinking
about making it open source btw.
